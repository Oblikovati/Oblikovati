# ADR-0061 — The faceted fallbacks retire in stages, against a debt that can only fall

**Status:** Accepted — on `m48/face-sense-invariant`. · **Scopes**
[Oblikovati#2251](https://github.com/Oblikovati/Oblikovati/issues/2251) (delete the `booleanCSG`
triangle-soup BSP engine) and the stages below. · **Builds on**
[ADR-0052](ADR-0052-planar-boolean-corefined-seam-classification.md) (the co-refined seam the mesh
arrangement rescues), [ADR-0056](ADR-0056-analytic-face-reconstruction-boolean.md) (the reconstruction that was to
replace it), [ADR-0058](ADR-0058-tolerant-analytic-boolean.md) (the mixed per-face boolean) and
[ADR-0060](ADR-0060-loop-framed-ruled-chart.md) (the loop-framed ruled chart that closed the last road
to `ops.Facet`). · **Adds:** the `fallbackDebt` ratchet, the shared-plane
rule in the boolean's membership classifier, and the certificate on the public curved-boolean entry. ·
**Deletes:** stage by stage, every call site into a faceted engine, then the engines. · **Touches:**
`archguard`, `kernel/brep` (classification, the coplanar predicate), `kernel/ops/boolean` (the public
entry).

## Context

Four call sites still hand a boolean to an engine that returns a triangle soup: two to `booleanCSG`,
one to the exact mesh arrangement, one to the mesh reconstruction. Each exists because some
configuration declines out of the analytic pipeline, and each produces a body whose curved faces are
gone for good — every downstream fillet, thread, mass property and export then reads facets.

They are also the reason the suite is slow. On the multipoint disk of the Inventor corpus, one feature
falling to the faceted path on a 400-face analytic body took the rebuild from two minutes to
thirty-five. The cost is not the fallback itself: it is that faceting is permanent, so every LATER
feature meets a 500-face polyhedron instead of a dozen analytic faces, and meets it at the grazing
angles a 24-gon makes and a cylinder never would.

The ground rules already forbid the shape — "a new engine shipped beside the old one as a fallback is
not complete", "a strangler migration carries the ticket that deletes the old system and the corpus
gate that unlocks it". What was missing is a NUMBER. Nothing counted how much of the boolean still
leaves the exact pipeline, so "we are retiring the fallback" was an intention, not a measurement, and
each stage's progress was invisible until the whole thing was done.

## Decision

**The retirement is measured before it is attempted.** `archguard.TestCSGFallbackDebt` pins three
counts that all reach zero exactly when the retirement is complete, and fails on ANY move, up or down,
after the pattern of `kernelNetDeltaPin`:

| number | what it counts | reaches zero at |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `faceted-entry-sites` | calls to `booleanCSG`, `booleanViaMeshbool`, `reconstructedCurvedBoolean` | stage 6 |
| `mixed-decline-returns` | returns of `ErrUnsupportedMixedBoolean` — the mixed boolean's named declines | stage 5 |
| `faceted-engine-files` | the non-test sources of `kernel/meshbool` and the `csg`/`meshbool`/`mesh_brep` files of `kernel/ops/boolean` | stage 7 |

The first two are the doors, the third is the room. Pinning the room as well is what stops the
retirement becoming a strangler that never strangles: closing every door while the engines stay is not
done. A FALL is a stage landing and the pin comes down in the same commit; a RISE is a new door and
needs a reason in the PR. Baseline taken 2026-09-03: 5, 3, 38.

**Stages run in dependency order, each with the corpus gate that unlocks the next.** They are, in
order: (0) count it; (1) the shared-plane classification below; (2) one ruled chart with partial
conic arcs, deleting the band frame, `cutCylinderUV` and the `splitFaceByPlane` ladder — measured
2026-09-03 at 22 non-test files and 3 637 lines under `curved_halfspace_*`, which is the stage's real
size
([#3509](https://github.com/Oblikovati/Oblikovati/issues/3509),
[#3508](https://github.com/Oblikovati/Oblikovati/issues/3508),
[#3255](https://github.com/Oblikovati/Oblikovati/issues/3255)); (3) sphere and torus charts, deleting
the ball-and-rod recognizers; (4) every ruled crossing through one general pipeline, deleting the 26
recognizers of `curvedExactPaths` ([#2246](https://github.com/Oblikovati/Oblikovati/issues/2246),
[#2153](https://github.com/Oblikovati/Oblikovati/issues/2153)); (5) a chart for freeform faces, which
ends the pass bucket; (6) failure becomes local, so one bad face no longer discards a whole analytic
body; (7) delete the engines ([#2251](https://github.com/Oblikovati/Oblikovati/issues/2251)).

**Stage 1 — a sub-face point on a plane the other solid shares is classified from both sides.** This
is the first stage to land, and it is the defect the multipoint disk was left on.

A boolean classifies each fragment of a face by asking whether a point ON that fragment lies inside the
other solid. `coplanarCover` resolves the point that lies on a FACE of the other solid, through the
ON/ON table. The case nobody had resolved is the point that lies on that face's PLANE and on no face of
it: it is not on the other solid's boundary, so the ON/ON table does not apply, yet neither evaluator
of the membership oracle can answer it.

- The ray-parity classifier pierces every face of that plane at t≈0, so every candidate direction
  grazes and `firstCleanDirection` finds none. Direction re-selection is the mechanism built for a
  grazing CROSSING; here the degeneracy is at the ray ORIGIN, and no direction can move it.
- The winding-number fallback zeroes exactly those faces by design (`faceSolidAngle`'s on-plane rule,
  which is right — a flat polygon subtends no solid angle at a coplanar point), and where the point
  also lies within the on-plane band of a thin feature's walls it zeroes those too, leaving a sum that
  reads "outside" for a point in the solid's interior.

`coplanarCover` now reports `onPlane` alongside `covered`, and `insidePlaneSafe` answers the on-plane
uncovered case by probing a resolution-derived step to EACH side of the plane. Requiring the two probes
to agree is what makes it a certificate rather than a guess: the point is provably not on the other
solid's boundary, so the material to either side is the same material, and a disagreement means the
point is on the boundary after all and the caller keeps its own verdict. No output coordinate moves —
this displaces a classification query, never geometry.

**One operation, one certification.** `CurvedBoolean` and `CurvedBooleanWithDiagnostics` — the entries
the model layer calls — went straight to `curvedExactBoolean`, while the identical call inside
`booleanGeneralExact` went through `curvedExactGuarded`. So a recognizer that over-matched to a valid
body of materially wrong shape was certified for the kernel's own caller and uncertified for the
feature layer's; only the feature layer's face-count gate stood between it and the model. Both public
entries now take the guarded path, which is what the guard's own doc always claimed.

**A predicate about planes answers "no" about a cylinder.** `coplanar` read both faces' planes before
checking their kind. A cylinder's `NormalAt(0, 0)` is a valid unit vector, so a cylinder whose radial
normal aligned with the plane's passed the parallel test and the type assertion panicked. The mixed
boolean's coplanar cover screens every face of the other operand, cylinders included, so this fired on
the slotted screw's cross-hole — where `safeRecompute` turned the panic into a sick feature and the cut
silently did nothing. `planeOf` reports the kind; `coplanar` is total.

**What did NOT land: widening the exact path's gate to a classification.** The feature layer gates the
exact curved boolean on a face COUNT — the tool must be a bare analytic primitive, or the target one
against an all-planar tool. That is a special case where the rules ask for a classification: the planar
path cannot consume a curved face at all, so "either operand carries one" is the honest gate. Measured,
it removes twenty `CodeBooleanAnalyticFaceted` defects from the multipoint disk and takes its rebuild
from 226 s to 39 s. It is held back because it also drives a fine-pitch coil join into the mesh
reconstruction, which does not terminate on that body: an unconditioned gate trades a faceting defect
for a hang. The widening waits on the cost gate stages 2 and 4 give the analytic paths, and
[#2254](https://github.com/Oblikovati/Oblikovati/issues/2254) carries it with the coil as its corpus.
Recording it here rather than landing it is the point: the gate is a known special case with a measured
replacement and a named blocker, not an open question.

## Consequences

The multipoint disk rebuilds as one closed solid, which it had not done since the part entered the
corpus. Two more defects fell out of the same trace: an uncertified public entry and a predicate that
panicked on a cylinder, both of which had been masked by the very gate this ADR wants to delete — which
is the argument for deleting it, not for keeping it.

The corpus keeps a reduced fixture for the classification defect. `wedgeStepBlock` is eighteen faces
carrying the three properties that reproduce it — a face in the shared plane, a razor wedge standing on
it whose converging walls fall inside the on-plane band, and a bore so the body takes the ray-parity
classifier — where the original input was a 523-face body. `TestUncoveredPointOnASharedPlaneIsInside`
asserts the fix AND that the plain query still gets it wrong, so it can never pass vacuously.

Stage 6 changes user-visible behaviour and is called out here before it is written: after it, an
unmodelled configuration is a sick feature naming the faulty face, not a faceted body that looks solid.
That is what "failure is local" asks for, and it is a deliberate trade — some parts that render today
will render as a quarantined feature instead. If a transition period is wanted, it is a gate inside
stage 6, and this ADR is superseded rather than edited to add one.

Until a stage lands, the tests that assert a fallback FIRES (`boolean_partial_rim_test` ×3,
`partial_rim_decline_test`, `diag_integration_test`) stay as they are: they assert the decline code,
never the faceted body, so each converts to a positive corpus case when its configuration lands rather
than being deleted to make a number move.
